# 🎮 Trigger Editor Quick Start Guide

`trigger_editor.py` is the core logic configuration tool for ResonaDesktopPet. it allows you to bring your pet to "life" without writing a single line of code.

## 1. Basic Concepts
A trigger consists of three parts:
- **Base Info**: ID, description, cooldown, probability, etc.
- **Conditions**: What must happen for the trigger to fire.
- **Actions**: What the pet does once triggered.

## 2. Detailed Conditions
You can combine multiple conditions. Supported types include:
- **System State**:
  - `cpu_temp` / `gpu_temp`: Checks if temperature exceeds a threshold.
  - `cpu_usage` / `gpu_usage`: Checks if usage is too high.
- **Software Environment**:
  - `process_active`: Fires when a specific app (e.g., `League of Legends.exe`) is in focus.
  - `url_match`: Fires when a browser visits a specific URL (e.g., `github.com`).
- **User Interaction**:
  - `hover_duration`: How long the mouse hovers over the pet.
  - `click_count`: Detects rapid click combos.
  - `long_press`: Long press detection.
- **Contextual Info**:
  - `weather_match`: Matches current weather conditions.
  - `time_range`: Fires during specific time periods (e.g., `23:00-05:00`).
- **Logic Nesting**:
  - `AND`: All sub-conditions must be met.
  - `OR`: Any one sub-condition is enough.

## 3. Detailed Actions
You can execute a sequence of actions upon triggering:
1. `speak`: Play a specific line. You can specify emotion tags (e.g., `<E:angry>`).
2. `delay`: Wait for a set duration before the next action.
3. `move_to`: Move the pet to a specific screen position.
4. `fade_out`: Decrease transparency (e.g., to simulate "hiding").
5. `random_group`: Randomly select one group of actions from several presets.

## 4. Quick Start Steps
1. **Open the Editor**: Run `python tools/trigger_editor.py`.
2. **Select Pack**: Choose `Resona_Default` or your custom pack.
3. **Create a Rule**:
   - Click "Add Trigger".
   - Set ID to `high_cpu_warning`.
   - Set Description to "High CPU warning".
4. **Set Conditions**:
   - Select `cpu_temp` and click "Add Condition".
   - In the property panel on the right, set `gt` (greater than) to `85`.
5. **Set Actions**:
   - Select `speak` and click "Insert Action".
   - In the property panel, set:
     - `text`: "Master, the computer is so hot, should we take a break?"
     - `emotion`: `<E:serious>`
6. **Save**: Click "Save & Sync".
7. **Test**: Run `python tools/sensor_mocker.py`, drag the CPU temp slider to 90, and watch your pet react.
