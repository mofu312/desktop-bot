# 🛠️ Developer Tools Guide

The `tools/` directory contains a suite of utilities to help you create and debug resource packs efficiently.

## 1. Trigger Editor (`trigger_editor.py`)
**The most essential tool** for graphically editing `triggers.json`.
- **How to Use**:
  1. Run `trigger_editor.py`.
  2. Select your resource pack from the top-left menu.
  3. Click "Add Trigger" and set an ID.
  4. **Add Conditions**: E.g., CPU Temp > 80 or Mouse Hover > 5s.
  5. **Add Actions**: E.g., `speak` (voice response) or `move_to` (move character).
  6. Click "Save & Sync".
- **Advanced**: Supports nested logic (AND/OR) for intelligent reactions.

## 2. Sensor Mocker (`sensor_mocker.py`)
A powerful tool for debugging triggers.
- **Purpose**: Test logic like "High CPU Warning" or "Full Screen Feedback" without actually stressing your hardware.
- **How to Use**:
  1. Set `debugtrigger = true` in `config.cfg`.
  2. Run `sensor_mocker.py`.
  3. Adjust sliders (e.g., drag CPU temp to 90).
  4. The pet will receive this mocked data in real-time and trigger corresponding reactions.

## 3. Image Preprocessor (`image_processor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Resona's UI uses a 1280x720 canvas. This tool resizes and aligns raw sprites to the **bottom-center** of the canvas automatically.
- **How to Use**: Drag and drop images or folders onto the script.

## 4. Sprite Organizer (`sprite_organizer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Batch renames loose sprite files into a standard format and generates the required `sum.json` based on assigned emotions.
- **How to Use**:
  1. Open the folder containing your sprites.
  2. Assign an emotion tag to each image.
  3. Enter an Outfit ID.
  4. Click generate; it will copy files to the correct pack directory and create the index.
