# ResonaDesktopPet

ResonaDesktopPet is a versatile desktop pet project that integrates Large Language Models (LLM), Text-to-Speech (SoVITS), and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies to provide a vivid and natural interactive experience.
Through customized resource packs and a wide variety of events, it offers an experience far beyond that of a typical desktop pet.
Please obtain resource packs compatible with this program on your own.

## 💡 Usage Tips

- **Sprite Aspect Ratio**: The UI does not strictly limit resolution, but please ensure your sprite files are **16:9**.
- **Performance**: TTS speed depends on your inference hardware, while LLM response speed depends on your network quality.
- **Voice Tuning**: If you are unsatisfied with the default voice quality, you can replace the reference audio and annotation text pointed to in `emotion.json` within your resource pack.
- **Language Matching**: It is recommended to keep the model training language, reference audio language, and the `text_tts` output from the LLM consistent. Currently only tested for **Chinese (zh)** and **Japanese (ja)**.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements & Notes

- **Inspiration**: Parts of the code in this project are referenced from [luna-sama](https://github.com/annali07/luna-sama).
- **Core Technology**: Designed specifically for interaction with [GPT-SoVITS](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS). Compatibility is only guaranteed for version `v2pro-20250604` and v2Pro models. If you need to train custom model weights, please use the corresponding version.
- **Environment**: The installation script includes a streamlined SoVITS runtime environment (distributed under the MIT license) to lower the barrier to entry.
- **Project Focus**: Focused on a high-efficiency, lightweight dialogue experience. There are currently no plans to add Live2D support, real-time screen recognition, or complex favorability systems.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Deep Interaction**: Connects to cloud or local LLMs to give your pet a unique personality and dialogue capabilities.
- **Full Voice Support**: High-quality voice output via SoVITS and semi-real-time voice dialogue via STT.
- **Low-End Friendly**: Can run theoretically without a GPU by using cloud LLMs and setting SoVITS to CPU mode.
- **Automated Deployment**: Provides a comprehensive installation script that supports one-click configuration of virtual environments. A Runtime environment option is available for beginners.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **UI Framework**: PySide6 (Qt for Python, LGPL license)
- **Language Models**: Supports OpenAI-compatible APIs and various mainstream cloud/local models.
- **Speech Recognition**: Fast offline recognition based on SenseVoice. Uses the default recording device; please ensure clear articulation without background noise.
- **Speech Synthesis**: GPT-SoVITS inference engine.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download the Project**: Clone this repository.
2. **Run the Installation Script**:
   - Right-click `setup.ps1` and select **"Run with PowerShell"**.
   - Follow the prompts to select an installation mode (Options 2 or 3 recommended) and download the default resource pack.
3. **Configure API Key**:
   - Open `config.cfg` and enter your LLM API Key. You can also use locally deployed LLMs.
4. **Configure SoVITS**:
   - Obtain the SoVITS integrated package from [here](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS/releases/tag/20250606v2pro). Extract it to the `GPT-SoVITS` directory so your path looks like: `ResonaDesktopPet\GPT-SoVITS\GPT-SoVITS-v2pro-20250604\api_v2.py`. Any method works as long as `api_v2.py` exists and can be called by the program.
   - If SoVITS is enabled, the program will start a SoVITS server for real-time speech synthesis upon startup.
5. **Start the Program**:
   - Double-click `run.bat` to begin interacting with your desktop pet.

## 🛠️ Extended Developer Tools (tools/)

This project includes several built-in tools for developers and resource pack creators:

- **Interaction Logic Editor** (`trigger_editor.py`): A GUI for editing `triggers.json` within resource packs. Supports complex conditions (system temperature, process status, time of day, etc.) and sequential actions.
- **Sensor Mocker** (`sensor_mocker.py`): Simulates system parameters (CPU/GPU temp, usage, clipboard content, etc.) for real-time testing of custom triggers. Enable by setting `debugtrigger = true` in `config.cfg`.
- **Image Preprocessor** (`image_processor.py`): Automatically centers and bottom-aligns PNG images, padding them with transparent pixels to 1280*720.
- **Sprite Organizer** (`sprite_organizer.py`): Batch renames and manages sprite assets and generates `sum.json`.
- Refer to the format in the default resource pack to create your own.

## ⚙️ Trigger System Explained

Using `trigger_editor.py`, you can configure highly personalized reaction logic. Current capabilities include:

### 1. Conditions
- **System Monitoring**: CPU/GPU temperature and usage.
- **Software Detection**: Specific process in focus, specific process running in background, specific URL visited (Chrome/Edge only), window title keyword matching.
- **User Interaction**: Hover duration, pointer leave duration, long press duration, double-click/combo count.
- **Environment Awareness**: Full-screen mode detection, weather matching, currently playing music (Netease Cloud Music only).
- **Time & Date**: Specific dates or time periods.
- **Others**: Idle time detection, resume from idle, clipboard keyword matching.
- **Logic Combinations**: Supports `AND`, `OR`, `CUMULATIVE`, and complex nested logic.

### 2. Actions
- **Speak** (`speak`): Plays specific voice lines with text and emotion tags.
- **Delay** (`delay`): Inserts wait time between actions.
- **Move To** (`move_to`): Moves the pet across the screen.
- **Fade Out** (`fade_out`): Changes pet brightness or transparency.
- **Random Group** (`random_group`): Randomly selects an action from a preset group (experimental).
- **Lock Interaction** (`lock_intermation`): Temporarily disables all interactions (experimental).
- **Exit App** (`exit_app`): Closes the program.
